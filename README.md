## Description
This is the follow up of a video-tutorial for building a REST API with Node.js using Express.js framework. The user will be able to Get, Post, Put, Delete and Get by id two sets of lists, each in their own shown routes.

## Installation
First we need to initialize our proyect by typing in the command line inside the proyect directory and selecting the setting you like the most  (Node.js with npm should already be installed in your OS):
```
npm init
```
Then the packages that we need to install before runing our server are listed bellow ready to run from the command line:
```
npm i express
```
```
npm i morgan
```
```
npm i ejs
```
```
npm i nodemon -D
```

package.json:
```
"dependencies": {
    "ejs": "^3.1.9",
    "express": "^4.18.2",
    "morgan": "^1.10.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.0.1"
  }
```

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.
